All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-14

- Fixes:
  - normalized `play` and `playnext` help usage alternatives without spaced pipes
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for command help alternative formatting

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-14

  - added `help <page_number>` support for opening a specific help page
- Docs:
  - updated the README command list with the new help usage
- Tests:
  - added coverage for targeted command help and direct help page selection

## [0.5.8] - 2026-04-13

- Fixes:
  - retried YouTube startup failures that exited before audio output through a cookie-aware yt-dlp URL fallback
  - prevented transient yt-dlp invalid-input startup failures from rapidly draining playlist queues
- Operations:
  - added an optional RSS watchdog so supervisors can restart long-running processes before native memory growth gets too high
  - capped Docker Compose app and MongoDB json-file logs to prevent unbounded disk growth
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for pre-audio YouTube pipeline fallback after invalid FFmpeg input
  - covered RSS watchdog configuration parsing

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-07

- Fixes:
  - applied live volume changes without restarting the active track when the stream started at 100% volume
  - avoided unnecessary YouTube seek/restart attempts after `volume` changes, which reduced follow-on yt-dlp startup failures
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for enabling live volume processing without refreshing the current track

## [0.5.6] - 2026-04-07

- Fixes:
  - paced live HTTP radio streams in realtime so FFmpeg no longer bursts the first seconds of PCM output before settling
  - sent the ICY metadata request header with the trailing CRLF FFmpeg expects during live radio startup
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for live radio FFmpeg args

## [0.5.5] - 2026-04-06

- Access control:
  - restricted guild radio preset writes so `station save` and `station delete` now require a DJ role or `Manage Server`
  - stopped treating empty DJ-role configuration as implicit write access for guild radio presets
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for denied preset writes without elevated access
  - added coverage for `Manage Server` fallback when no DJ roles are configured

## [0.5.4] - 2026-04-06

- Security and resolver hardening:
  - tightened URL host validation for YouTube, SoundCloud, Deezer, Spotify, short-link expansion, and direct command parsing so hostile lookalike hosts no longer pass substring checks
  - clamped gateway heartbeat intervals before scheduling timers so malformed remote values cannot keep long-lived timers around indefinitely
  - reordered HTML entity decoding in metadata resolvers and URL normalization so encoded ampersands are decoded last
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for strict host matching and bounded gateway heartbeat scheduling

## [0.5.3] - 2026-04-06

- Runtime and platform updates:
  - raised the supported Node.js baseline from 20 to 24 for local runtime, CI, and container builds
  - switched Docker build and runtime images to `node:24-bookworm-slim`
  - refreshed README requirements and setup guidance to reflect the Node 24 baseline
- CI and security hardening:
  - expanded CI to run typecheck, build, tests, Docker image validation, and Node runtime compatibility checks
  - added a dedicated security workflow for dependency review, production `pnpm audit`, and CodeQL analysis
  - upgraded the CodeQL workflow to the v4 action series and aligned its JavaScript/TypeScript configuration with supported build modes
- Tests:
  - verified the Node 24 migration with local typecheck, build, and full test-suite passes

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-06

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-22

- Playlist startup and queue UX:
  - started external playlists and YouTube mixes from the first playable track immediately, then loaded the remaining tracks in the background
  - added fast-path handling for YouTube `RD` / `RDMM` mix links so the visible watch track starts instantly
  - hydrated fast-start mix placeholders with real metadata after playback begins and suppressed placeholder `Now playing` follow-up messages
  - cleaned up queue and now-playing formatting, added clickable `Now Playing` links, moved compact session state to embed footers, and improved minimal-mode text layout
  - added a guild-level `minimalmode` / `minimal` setting for compact text-first responses
- Persistence and recovery:
  - changed active-session snapshot flushing to persist playback progress while audio is running instead of only on command mutations
  - improved restart recovery accuracy so resumed sessions return closer to the last heard position
- Source and mirror support:
  - added Tidal URL support for track, album, playlist, and mix metadata resolution with Deezer-first then YouTube mirroring
  - added Tidal token bootstrap caching, ISRC-aware matching, and concurrent collection resolution for faster large imports
  - added additional metadata mirror sources for Bandcamp, Audiomack, Mixcloud, and JioSaavn URLs
- YouTube reliability:
  - hardened `yt-dlp` startup and metadata resolution with multi-client strategy retries
  - added runtime fallback from `yt-dlp` playback startup to the existing `play-dl` pipeline when needed
  - shortened first-track startup waits for normal YouTube playback so audio starts sooner after lookup completes
- Tooling and CI:
  - fixed Node test discovery to use stable `node --test test` semantics in CI

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-18

- Session and persistence model:
  - changed playback sessions from guild-wide to voice-channel-scoped so one guild can run multiple independent voice sessions

- Access, configuration, and operational behavior:
  - added a guild default volume command and persisted per-guild player volume for new sessions
  - hardened permission management with role-based fallbacks, guild-state caching, and clearer channel-context errors
  - stopped retrying known non-retryable server errors
  - migrated the bot runtime to TypeScript and updated Docker startup to build TypeScript output before launch
  - cached short-link normalization, cached global guild/user counts, and added reaction cleanup after pagination/search picks
  - added unhealthy-exit runtime monitoring, Deezer stream timeout/cache tuning, max-pending-track limits, and periodic ephemeral-state cleanup
- Tests:
  - added regression coverage for multi-session shutdown recovery ordering, snapshot persistence, missing-channel cleanup, and voice-channel-scoped 24/7 behavior

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-16

- HTTP/radio playback and URL classification hardening:
  - split direct HTTP audio files from live radio streams so `.mp3`-style URLs no longer default to radio handling
  - restored live-radio handling for generic `m3u8`/`m3u`/`pls` inputs, including relative HLS playlist targets and fallback live classification
  - routed generic HTTP media URLs through direct ffmpeg playback instead of `play-dl`
  - simplified live HTTP ffmpeg input flags for wider compatibility with Icecast/Shoutcast/Securenet-style streams
  - enriched startup playback errors with ffmpeg stderr details to make failing URLs diagnosable
- YouTube and seek behavior:
  - changed single YouTube URL and search resolution to prefer `yt-dlp` before `play-dl`
  - switched YouTube seek startup to prefer direct media URLs for more reliable long seeks
  - rejected seek targets at or beyond the known track length instead of failing later during playback startup
- Radio now-playing and progress UX:
  - kept live progress labeling for real radio streams while showing `Unknown` for non-live tracks with missing duration
  - added ffmpeg-based audio sampling for HLS radio links so AudD fallback can work on playlist-style live streams
  - kept radio-only now-playing recognition behavior tied to tracks classified as `radio-stream`

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-10

- Spotify playlist mirroring fix:
  - preserved artist metadata when Spotify tracks are mirrored to YouTube so playlist and album imports use `artist - title` searches instead of title-only lookups
  - normalized Spotify mirror duration handoff to avoid feeding formatted duration labels back through the preview-length fallback path
  - added targeted regression coverage for Spotify playlist collection mirroring

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-09

- Amazon Music mirroring:
  - added Amazon Music URL detection for track and album links
  - resolved Amazon Music metadata through Amazon's web `config.json` and `legacy/lookup` endpoints before HTML fallback
  - mirrored Amazon tracks to Deezer first with YouTube fallback
  - mirrored Amazon album links to Deezer album-track search so collection links resolve to multiple playable tracks instead of collapsing to one song
  - removed the temporary `song.link` dependency from the Amazon path
- Now playing cleanup:
  - removed the `Source` field from all `now` / `now playing` embeds
  - simplified radio `now` output to focus on detected song, artist, progress, and linked station name
  - restored the radio recognition support footer for live radio embeds only

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-08

- Radio now-playing recognition and live-stream UX:
  - added radio now-playing detection from ICY metadata with optional AudD fallback via `AUDD_API_TOKEN`
  - upgraded radio `now` output to show the detected live song and recognition source
  - added a subtle support footer on radio recognition embeds because that lookup path has ongoing API cost
  - changed `play` so active radio/live playback is interrupted immediately and the new track or stream starts next instead of waiting in queue
  - normalized live progress labeling from `live/unknown` to `Live`
- Docs and branding refresh:
  - reworked README styling with badges, tables, collapsible setup sections, and project links
  - added repository logo and official website link to the README
  - rewrote self-hosting docs around the expected Fluxer deployment path
  - aligned configuration, architecture, support, contribution, privacy, and terms docs with the current codebase and stored data model

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-08

  - added Spotify-specific track metadata fields and player wiring for mirrored resolution paths
  - documented Spotify credentials and current non-native playback model in README and architecture/config docs
- YouTube seek startup reliability:
  - increased initial playback startup timeout for large seek offsets so long YouTube seeks have more time to produce their first audio chunk
  - added targeted regression coverage for large-offset seek startup timeout behavior
- YouTube single-track metadata fallback:
  - added yt-dlp JSON metadata fallback for single YouTube URL resolution when `play-dl.video_info()` fails
  - preserved the existing `Unknown` fallback only for cases where both resolvers fail
  - added regression coverage for cloud-style single-link resolution failures that still have valid yt-dlp metadata
- Radio stream URL support:
  - added generic live-stream detection for direct `audio/*` responses and simple `m3u`/`pls` radio playlist links
  - resolved radio links into dedicated live tracks and routed playback through direct HTTP ffmpeg streaming instead of `play-dl`
  - marked live radio tracks as non-seekable and added targeted playback/resolver coverage

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-06

- Project modularity refactor:
  - split `MusicPlayer` into smaller domain modules and reduced the main player file below the 2000-line cap
  - separated player source logic into dedicated Audius, SoundCloud, Deezer, URL resolver, process, and track factory modules
  - introduced explicit source client wrappers so `MusicPlayer` now talks to domain APIs instead of a flat method mix
  - split command helper logic into dedicated formatting, context, access, guild-stats, and search-selection modules
  - extracted router utility and router operation helpers to reduce `commandRouter` size and tighten responsibility boundaries
  - centralized duplicated command response/progress payload helpers in a shared `responseUtils` module
- Maintenance:
  - enforced the rule that no file in `src/` or `test/` exceeds 2000 lines
- Gateway and live processing:
  - improved invalid-session recovery to delay resume/identify retries correctly and clear stale retry timers during shutdown
  - added a live PCM audio processor with runtime volume, EQ, and filter preset transitions for stream-safe audio shaping
- Tests:
  - verified player, command, and config flows after the refactor with targeted regression coverage
  - added live audio processor coverage for runtime volume changes and live-filter preset support detection

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-06

  - switched ARL media format requests to configurable `BF_CBC_STRIPE` format lists (`DEEZER_TRACK_FORMATS`, default `MP3_128,MP3_64`)
  - improved cookie handling compatibility for fetch runtimes that only expose a single `set-cookie` header accessor
- Queue-end and idle-disconnect fixes:
  - fixed queue-empty handling so stale stream-tail state no longer blocks idle timeout scheduling
  - added explicit voice stream stop on queue end/reset paths to avoid lingering stream state

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-05

- Queue/session flow fixes:
  - improved session validation and track display handling during command routing
  - prevented `queueEmpty` announcements while playback is still active
  - restored YouTube search priority in the affected fallback path
