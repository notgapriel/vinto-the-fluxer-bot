## What It Does

- Reliable gateway handling with reconnect, resume, heartbeat watchdogs, and REST retry logic.
- Playback from YouTube, SoundCloud, Deezer, Audius, radio streams, and mirrored imports from Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, Bandcamp, Audiomack, Mixcloud, and JioSaavn URLs.
- Independent multi-voice playback sessions per guild, with separate queues per voice channel.
- Voice-channel-scoped 24/7 mode plus one-shot restart recovery for active non-24/7 sessions.
- Fast playlist UX with first-track start plus background queueing for large external playlists and mixes.
- Optional opportunistic YouTube startup prefetch to reduce time-to-audio for direct video playback.
- Persistent guild playlists, favorites, history, queue templates, recap data, and lightweight user taste/reputation signals in MongoDB.
- Built-in `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and Prometheus `/metrics` endpoints.
- Optional Sentry reporting, opt-in runtime playback diagnostics, and memory telemetry / heap snapshot controls.

## Self-Hosting On Fluxer

> This project is intended to be self-hosted for Fluxer.

The defaults already point at the official Fluxer services:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `API_BASE` | `https://api.fluxer.app/v1` |
| `GATEWAY_URL` | `wss://gateway.fluxer.app` |

For most operators, the practical requirements are:

- a valid Fluxer bot token
- MongoDB
- `ffmpeg`
- ideally `yt-dlp`

`GATEWAY_ONLY_MODE=1` only skips the startup REST health check and gateway discovery. During normal Fluxer operation the bot still talks to the Fluxer REST API.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `>= 24` |
| MongoDB | local or managed |
| `ffmpeg` | on `PATH` or via `FFMPEG_BIN` |
| `yt-dlp` | strongly recommended for YouTube playback |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install pnpm, then copy env

If `pnpm` is not installed yet, enable it through Corepack first:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Then install dependencies and create your env file:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### 2. Fill the minimum env values

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_fluxer_bot_token
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
```

### 3. Start the bot

```bash
pnpm start
```

Useful commands:

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Start | `pnpm start` |
| Dev mode | `pnpm dev` |
| Build | `pnpm run build` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm run typecheck` |
| Tests | `pnpm test` |
| Spotify token helper | `pnpm spotify:token` |

## Deploy On Coolify

This repo now includes [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and a production [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for Coolify.

### Recommended Coolify setup

- Use the Docker Compose deployment type.
- Set at least `BOT_TOKEN` in Coolify.
- Leave `MONGODB_URI` unset if you want to use the bundled `mongo` service from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Expose port `9091` if you want Coolify or external monitoring to reach `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics`.
- Add any optional provider secrets such as `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `DEEZER_ARL`, or `SENTRY_DSN` directly in Coolify as environment variables.
- The bundled Docker defaults already set conservative memory values: `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024 --openssl-legacy-provider`, `MONGODB_MAX_POOL_SIZE=20`, and `MONGODB_MIN_POOL_SIZE=2`. Override them in Coolify only if you want different limits.
- The app now exits with code `1` if it stays unhealthy for too long, so `restart: unless-stopped` can actually restart the container. Tune this with `UNHEALTHY_EXIT_AFTER_MS` if needed.

If you use an external MongoDB instead of the bundled container, set:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:password@your-mongo-host:27017
```

The container image already installs `ffmpeg` and the standalone `yt-dlp` package, so YouTube playback dependencies are present inside the app container.

## Recommended Setups

<details>
<summary><strong>Minimal setup</strong></summary>

Good for the simplest Fluxer self-hosted deployment.

- keep `ENABLE_YT_SEARCH=1`
- keep `ENABLE_YT_PLAYBACK=1`
- leave Spotify, Deezer, and Tidal credentials empty
- install `ffmpeg`
- install `yt-dlp`

This still supports YouTube, SoundCloud, Audius, radio streams, and keyless metadata mirroring from Bandcamp, Audiomack, Mixcloud, and JioSaavn URLs.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify import setup</strong></summary>

Use this if users should be able to paste Spotify URLs.

- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- set `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- optionally set `SPOTIFY_MARKET`

Spotify is metadata resolution only. Playback is mirrored to Deezer first when `DEEZER_ARL` is configured, otherwise to YouTube.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deezer-first setup</strong></summary>

Use this if you want Deezer-first text search and the best direct Deezer playback path.

- set `DEEZER_ARL`
- keep `ENABLE_DEEZER_IMPORT=1`

With `DEEZER_ARL` configured, plain text `play` resolution prefers Deezer before falling back to YouTube.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| YouTube playback fails | `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`, `YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE`, `YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`, `YTDLP_YOUTUBE_CLIENT` |
| Commands fail but gateway connects | `API_BASE`, token validity, runtime REST access |
| Voice joins but no audio | Fluxer voice-side setup, `VOICE_MAX_BITRATE`, LiveKit-based publisher flow, and whether a restart recovery snapshot existed before reboot |
| Container becomes `unhealthy` and just sits there | Docker does not restart a process only because the healthcheck failed. Keep `UNHEALTHY_EXIT_ENABLED=1` so prolonged `/readyz` failure forces a real restart, and inspect gateway/API reachability |

<details>
<summary><strong>More detail</strong></summary>

### Bot starts but cannot play YouTube

- make sure `ffmpeg` works on the host
- install `yt-dlp`
- if YouTube returns bot checks, set `YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE` or `YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`
- if a specific YouTube extractor profile is unstable, try `YTDLP_YOUTUBE_CLIENT=ios,android,web`
- the runtime now retries multiple `yt-dlp` client strategies and can fall back to `play-dl`, so outright startup failures usually point to host binaries or provider-side blocking
- `ENABLE_YOUTUBE_PREFETCHED_PLAYBACK=1` can improve startup latency for direct YouTube playback, but trades some robustness for speed

### Bot connects to gateway but commands fail

- check that `API_BASE` still points to the Fluxer API
- verify the token works against both Fluxer Gateway and REST
- remember that `GATEWAY_ONLY_MODE` does not remove the runtime REST dependency

### Bot joins voice but no audio is heard

- check the voice-side setup on Fluxer first
- the bot uses the LiveKit-based publisher in `src/voice/VoiceConnection.ts`
- lower `VOICE_MAX_BITRATE` if your voice environment is bandwidth-constrained

</details>

## Configuration

`src/config.ts` is the main source of truth for runtime env parsing and validation. A few direct-read env vars also exist outside it, such as `BOT_OWNER_USER_ID` for owner-only maintenance commands and the script-only Spotify helper vars.
