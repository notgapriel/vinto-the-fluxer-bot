## Overview

| Area | Highlights |
| --- | --- |
| Playback | YouTube, SoundCloud, Deezer, Audius, radio streams, Spotify/Apple Music mirroring |
| Reliability | reconnect, resume, heartbeat watchdogs, REST retries, graceful shutdown |
| Persistence | playlists, favorites, history, templates, recap state, reputation/taste signals |
| Operations | `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, structured logging, optional Sentry |

## What It Does

- Reliable gateway handling with reconnect, resume, heartbeat watchdogs, and REST retry logic.
- Playback from YouTube, SoundCloud, Deezer, Audius, radio streams, and mirrored imports from Spotify and Apple Music URLs.
- Persistent guild playlists, favorites, history, queue templates, recap data, and lightweight user taste/reputation signals in MongoDB.
- Built-in `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and Prometheus `/metrics` endpoints.
- Optional Sentry reporting and opt-in runtime playback diagnostics.

## Self-Hosting On Fluxer

> This project is intended to be self-hosted for Fluxer.

The defaults already point at the official Fluxer services:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `API_BASE` | `https://api.fluxer.app/v1` |
| `GATEWAY_URL` | `wss://gateway.fluxer.app` |

For most operators, the practical requirements are:

- a valid Fluxer bot token
- MongoDB
- `ffmpeg`
- ideally `yt-dlp`

`GATEWAY_ONLY_MODE=1` only skips the startup REST health check and gateway discovery. During normal Fluxer operation the bot still talks to the Fluxer REST API.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | `>= 20` |
| MongoDB | local or managed |
| `ffmpeg` | on `PATH` or via `FFMPEG_BIN` |
| `yt-dlp` | strongly recommended for YouTube playback |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and copy env

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### 2. Fill the minimum env values

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_fluxer_bot_token
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
```

### 3. Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

Useful commands:

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Start | `npm start` |
| Dev mode | `npm run dev` |
| Tests | `npm test` |
| Spotify token helper | `npm run spotify:token` |

## Deploy On Coolify

This repo now includes [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and a production [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) for Coolify.

### Recommended Coolify setup

- Use the Docker Compose deployment type.
- Set at least `BOT_TOKEN` in Coolify.
- Leave `MONGODB_URI` unset if you want to use the bundled `mongo` service from `docker-compose.yml`.
- Expose port `9091` if you want Coolify or external monitoring to reach `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/metrics`.
- Add any optional provider secrets such as `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `DEEZER_ARL`, or `SENTRY_DSN` directly in Coolify as environment variables.

If you use an external MongoDB instead of the bundled container, set:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:password@your-mongo-host:27017
```

The container image already installs `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`, so YouTube playback dependencies are present inside the app container.

## Recommended Setups

<details>
<summary><strong>Minimal setup</strong></summary>

Good for the simplest Fluxer self-hosted deployment.

- keep `ENABLE_YT_SEARCH=1`
- keep `ENABLE_YT_PLAYBACK=1`
- leave Spotify and Deezer credentials empty
- install `ffmpeg`
- install `yt-dlp`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spotify import setup</strong></summary>

Use this if users should be able to paste Spotify URLs.

- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- set `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`
- optionally set `SPOTIFY_MARKET`

Spotify is metadata resolution only. Playback is mirrored to Deezer first when `DEEZER_ARL` is configured, otherwise to YouTube.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Deezer-first setup</strong></summary>

Use this if you want Deezer-first text search and the best direct Deezer playback path.

- set `DEEZER_ARL`
- keep `ENABLE_DEEZER_IMPORT=1`

With `DEEZER_ARL` configured, plain text `play` resolution prefers Deezer before falling back to YouTube.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| YouTube playback fails | `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`, `YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE`, `YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER` |
| Commands fail but gateway connects | `API_BASE`, token validity, runtime REST access |
| Voice joins but no audio | Fluxer voice-side setup, `VOICE_MAX_BITRATE`, LiveKit-based publisher flow |

<details>
<summary><strong>More detail</strong></summary>

### Bot starts but cannot play YouTube

- make sure `ffmpeg` works on the host
- install `yt-dlp`
- if YouTube returns bot checks, set `YTDLP_COOKIES_FILE` or `YTDLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER`

### Bot connects to gateway but commands fail

- check that `API_BASE` still points to the Fluxer API
- verify the token works against both Fluxer Gateway and REST
- remember that `GATEWAY_ONLY_MODE` does not remove the runtime REST dependency

### Bot joins voice but no audio is heard

- check the voice-side setup on Fluxer first
- the bot uses the LiveKit-based publisher in `src/voice/VoiceConnection.js`
- lower `VOICE_MAX_BITRATE` if your voice environment is bandwidth-constrained

</details>
