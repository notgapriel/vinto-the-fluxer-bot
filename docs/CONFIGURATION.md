# Configuration Reference

All environment variables are parsed in `src/config.js`. `.env.example` is the template to copy from.

## Required

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Bot token used for REST and Gateway authentication. |
| `MONGODB_URI` | MongoDB connection string. |

## Self-Hosting Notes

- The intended deployment target is Fluxer. The default `API_BASE` and `GATEWAY_URL` already point to the official Fluxer services.
- Most operators should leave `API_BASE` and `GATEWAY_URL` unchanged unless they know they need different Fluxer endpoints.
- `GATEWAY_ONLY_MODE=1` skips the startup REST probe and gateway auto-discovery, but normal bot operation still depends on the Fluxer REST API.
- Spotify credentials are optional as a group. If you set one of `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`, you must set all three.
- `DEEZER_ARL` is optional, but it enables Deezer-first text resolution and the best direct Deezer playback path.

## Practical Presets

### Simple Fluxer setup

Use this if you want the easiest normal Fluxer self-hosted setup.

- required: `BOT_TOKEN`, `MONGODB_URI`
- recommended: install `ffmpeg` and `yt-dlp`
- leave Spotify, SoundCloud, and Deezer credentials empty

## Runtime Notes

- 24/7 is voice-channel-scoped. The `247` command writes to the active voice channel profile, not to a guild-wide switch.
- Active non-24/7 sessions still write restart-recovery snapshots so playback can come back after a bot restart.
- Empty non-24/7 sessions are not persisted across restarts.
- The legacy session panel fields may still exist in stored docs, but the panel feature is disabled in the active runtime path.

### Spotify URL support

Use this if Spotify links should work.

- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- set `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- set `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`

Spotify URLs resolve metadata only. Playback is mirrored to Deezer or YouTube.

### Deezer-first resolution

Use this if you want better Deezer coverage.

- set `DEEZER_ARL`

That enables Deezer-first text search and direct Deezer media resolution when possible.
